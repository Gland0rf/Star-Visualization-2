The escape velocity from a star's gravitational field depends ONLY on the mass of the star and the distance from the star, not
on the mass of the planet. This is why, when you increase the star's mass, the planet's escape velocity increases, and if the
planet's velocity isn't adjusted accordingly, it might no longer be sufficient to stay in orbit.
Escape velocity is determined by: sqrt(2GM / r), where G is the gravitational constant, M the the mass of the star, and r
the distance between planet and star.

Formula for orbital velocity: sqrt(GM / r)
For elliptical orbits, you would adjust the initial velocity to be less than the circular orbit velocity at that distance.

Lagrange points:
There are 5 Lagrange points.

L1 is located located between the two large bodies. The distance dL1 from the smaller body (mass m2) can be approximated
for systems like the Earth-Sun or Earth-Moon by: dL1 = R * sqrt3((m2 / 3 * m1)), where R is the distance between the two
large bodies, m1 is the mass of the larger body, and m2 is the mass of the smaller body

L2 has the same calculation like L1, just in the reverse vector.

L3, L4, and L5 do not have to be calculated, as they are points on the orbit of the smaller body.
