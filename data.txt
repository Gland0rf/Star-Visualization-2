The escpae velocity from a star's gravitational field depends ONLY on the mass of the star and the distance from the star, not
on the mass of the planet. This is why, when you increase the star's mass, the planet's escape velocity increases, and if the
planet's velocity isn't adjusted accordingly, it might no longer be sufficient to stay in orbit.
Escape velocity is determined by: sqrt(2GM / r), where G is the gravitational constant, M the the mass of the star, and r
the distance between planet and star.

Formula for orbital velocity: sqrt(GM / r)
For elliptical orbits, you would adjust the initial velocity to be less than the circular orbit velocity at that distance.
